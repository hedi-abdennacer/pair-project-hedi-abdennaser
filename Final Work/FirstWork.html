            <div class="first-text"> TUNIS CITY <br>A modern metropolis in full growth and major historic city, Tunis is always full of
                surprises. On the side of the medina,
                numerous ancient buildings open their doors, some transformed into museums or cultural centres,
                others into restaurants and tea rooms. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, the medina conceals
                treasures. From its gates extend picturesque quarters with beautiful façades from the 1900s, whilst on
                the peripheries, chic restaurants
                and entertainment venues rub shoulders in the modern quarters.

                <div class="second-text"> SIDI-BOU-SAID <br>Close to the capital, a prestigious location and striking views: this is the
                    introduction to the Coasts of Carthage, named after one of the most glorious ancient cities of the
                    Mediterranean. Founded by the Phoenicians, destroyed then rebuilt by the Romans, Carthage is today a
                    fashionable city. Next door, Sidi Bou Said is an elegant village where the blue and white houses
                    jostle with each other on the hillside, facing the sea. Stretching out close to these inspiring
                    locations are the beaches of Gammarth and La Marsa.</div>

                <div class="third-text"> TABARKA <br>Visitors choose Tabarka for its exceptional location, between the sea and the
                    mountains. The beaches of golden sand are framed by rocky spurs and forests of pine and cork oak.
                    The crystalline waters hide the precious red coral in its depths. The characteristic silhouette of
                    the Genoese Fort, perched upon an islet, is the emblem of Tabarka. The mountainous backcountry holds
                    the promise of fantastic excursions and hiking around the village of Ain Draham, the entry point to
                    a vast forested mountain range.</div>

                    seductions where entertainment and exoticism coexist harmoniously. As a major modern city, it’s one
                    of Tunisia’s most lively coastal resorts. As a historic city, it has conserved a magnificent medina
                    and exceptional monuments from the Middle Ages. Just a few minutes away, a tourist town with
                    Andalusian charm has been built especially for holiday-goers, around a marina: the integrated resort
                    of Port El Kantaoui.</div>
